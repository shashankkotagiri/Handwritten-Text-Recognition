## 📝 Abstract

Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) converts handwritten text into machine-readable form using machine learning techniques. This project focuses on building an accurate and efficient HTR system to address challenges like varying handwriting styles. With applications in education, data digitization, and automation, our system aims to improve recognition accuracy using OCR and supervised learning.

## 📁 Project Files

* **`HTR_MODEL_3_002.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook with all Python code for building, training, and testing the model.
* **`C21_HTR_Documentation.docx`**: The complete project report and documentation.
* **`C21-HTR.pptx`**: The final project presentation slides.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1.  Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2.  **Download the trained model (`.h5` file) from the link below.** This file is too large for GitHub and is hosted externally.
    * **➡️ Download Model:** [**HTR\_MODEL\_3\_002.h5**](Paste your Google Drive link here)
3.  Place the downloaded `HTR_MODEL_3_002.h5` file in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook.
4.  Open the `HTR_MODEL_3_002.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter and run the cells.

## 💡 Future Scope

* **Enhanced Accuracy:** Improve recognition accuracy using advanced deep learning models like Transformer-based architectures.
